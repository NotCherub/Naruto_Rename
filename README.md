# Naruto_Rename

Usually when you download episodes of Naruto Shippuden they are randomly named,atleast when downloaded from torrents.
So, I made this program to get names from Wikipedia page of [List of Naruto Shippuden Episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto:_Shippuden_episodes)

I downloaded Naruto Shippuden from [torrent](http://1337x.to/torrent/2182598/AnimeRG-Naruto-Shippuden-Complete-Series-001-500-Naruto-Shippuuden-720p-HEVC-x265-Batch-pseudo/), so this program works for this type of files only. But you can use the get the episode number of the file and use getName function to get name of that episode.

The program doesn't change name and halt somewhere, you have to manually change names.
